      summary: Build a Docker image from a Dockerfile
      description: |-
        This API builds a new container image from a Dockerfile that is stored on your local machine and pushes the image to the private Bluemix registry (corresponding IBM Containers command: `cf ic build`).

         To push an image to your Bluemix registry, a namespace must be set for the organization. Run `cf ic namespace get` or call the `GET /registry/namespaces` API to check if a namespace is already set. If not, run `cf ic namespace set NAMESPACE` or call the `PUT /registry/namespaces/{namespace}` API to set a namespace for your organization.

      summary: Create and start a single container
      description: "This endpoint creates and starts a single container in your space
        based on the Docker image that is specified in the Image field of the request
        json. A single container in IBM Containers is similar to a container that
        you create in your local Docker environment. Single containers are a good
        way to start with IBM Containers and to learn about how containers work in
        the IBM Cloud and the features that IBM Containers provides. They are also
        recommended when you want to run simple app tests or during the development
        process of an app. \n\n In the Docker API there are two separate APIs to create
        and start a container. However in IBM Containers a container is created and
        started in a single API call. Therefore, this API merges parameters from the
        Docker API to create and start container. \n\n To create a container with
        IBM Containers, you must at least define the image that the container is based
        on.\n\n- Image: You must include the full path to the image in your private
        Bluemix registry in the format: `registry.ng.bluemix.net/<namespace>/<image>`."

        number of input and output transactions per second (IOPS). \n\n After you
        have created a volume, you must mount it to a container by using the `--volume`
        option in the `cf ic run` (single containers) or `cf ic group create` (container
        groups) command. You can also define the volume as part of the HTTP body and
        send a request to the `POST /containers/create` (single containers) or `POST
        /containers/groups` (container groups) endpoints. \n\n Note: If you mount
        multiple containers in a space to the same volume, they share the data in
        the volume and can access them anytime. When a container is deleted, the associated

      description: "This endpoint creates a new file share in a space (corresponding
        IBM Containers command: `cf ic volume fs-create FSNAME FSSIZE FSIOPS`). \n\n
        A file share is a persistent NFS-based (Network File System) storage system
        that hosts Docker volumes in a Bluemix space and allows a user to store and
        access container and app-related files. To store files in a file share, you
        must create a container volume and save the data into this volume.\n\n As
        soon as you create your first volume in a space with the `cf ic volume create
        VOLNAME` command or the `POST /volumes/create` API endpoint, a default file
        share with 20 GB at 4 IOPS (Input Output operations Per Second) is created
        at no cost. \n\nThe organization manager can create file shares with specific
        storage size and IOPS to meet the storage needs of the space. File shares
        can be provisioned in sizes from 20 GB to 12 TB and at IOPS per GB of 0.25,
        2 or 4. Run `cf ic volume fs-flavor-list` or call the `GET /volumes/fs/flavors/json`
        API endpoint to retrieve a list of available file share sizes. The file share
        size in relation to the number of IOPS impacts the speed that data can be
        read and written from and to the container volume."
